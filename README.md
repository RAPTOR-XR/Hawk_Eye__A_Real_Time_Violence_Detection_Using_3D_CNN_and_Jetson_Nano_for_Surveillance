# Hawk Eye A Real Time Violence Detection Using 3D CNN and Jetson Nano for Surveillance
Violent action detection has become a trending
topic and active research domain of computer vision and video
processing within the past few years. In this paper, we detect
violence in real-time using the Spatio-temporal feature with 3D
CNN, which is a DL violence detection framework, specifically
suited for crowded places. Here, we have used embedded devices
in the form of Jetson Nano to feed it with the dataset and test
our model to evaluate and eradicate the issues present in cloudbased systems. An alert is sent immediately to the local police
station or security agency as soon as a violent activity is detected
so that urgent preventive measures can be taken. We have used
four different datasets in which we got an overall success rate of
96%-99%.
